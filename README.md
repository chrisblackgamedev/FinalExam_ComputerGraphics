For this final exam I have recreated a Pac-Man level in 3d using shaders to enhance the overall visual style of the game. 

The shaders I've used are as follows: 

Hologram Shader: Used on my Pac-Man Character, ghosts and wall objects to give a distinct glow to the objects. 

Scrolling texture shader: Used on my background plane. This shader adds a discrete but aesthetically pleasing background whereas the original was plain black. 

Specular Lighting model: From the first half of the course, the specular lighting model provides a different look for my spherical coins, adding to the 3D enhancement of the game.

Color Correction Shader: Lastly, I utilized color correction on my larger sphere coins to achieve the pink effect seen in game. This provides a distinct look from the regular coins while maintaining the visibility of the object.
